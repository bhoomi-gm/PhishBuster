## PhishBuster Overview

This project implements an intelligent system for detecting phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. Phishing attacks, where malicious actors impersonate legitimate websites to steal sensitive information, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Our solution provides real-time URL analysis to help users identify potentially dangerous websites.

##  Key Features

-  Web-based interface for easy URL checking
-  Machine learning-powered detection system
-  Real-time analysis and quick results
-  High accuracy in identifying phishing attempts
-  REST API support for system integration

##  Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, Template-based rendering
- **Model Serialization**: Pickle/Joblib

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```
  flask
  scikit-learn
  pandas
  numpy
  joblib
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

##  How It Works

1. User inputs a URL through the web interface
2. The system extracts relevant features from the URL
3. Our trained machine learning model analyzes these features
4. Results are displayed showing whether the URL is legitimate or potentially phishing

##  Performance

The system has been tested on a comprehensive dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs, achieving:
- High accuracy in detection
- Low false-positive rate
- Real-time analysis capability
- Scalable performance for production use
