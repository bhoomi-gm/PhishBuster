Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive 
information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. 
These attacks are used to trick users into revealing sensitive information by imitating legitimate websites, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. 
This project aims to develop an effective phishing domain detection system by combining machine learning, heuristic analysis, and domain reputation methods.

The main goal of this project is to create a domain authentication system that would detect if a given domain url is legit or fake website created to perform fraud. 
By combining various types of machine learning algorithms and methods these problems will be tested.  
We plan on creating a web Interface along with suitable Rest-API's will be created to help find the solution easily.

The system will be tested on a dataset of phishing and non-phishing websites to evaluate its accuracy,
false-positive rate, and scalability, demonstrating the systemâ€™s potential to mitigate phishing threats in real-world scenarios.
